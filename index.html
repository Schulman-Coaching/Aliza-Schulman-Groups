Do you want to just feel at peace within yourself already? The key to living a happy successful life is in your relationship with yourself and others. I have helped hundreds of people deal with life's many challenges including: conflict and relationships issues (with partners, children, stepchildren, friends, coworkers), anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem, commitment and attachment problems and with life transitions such as parenthood, divorce, and death.</p>

                <h2>About Aliza Schulman</h2>
                <p>I am a licensed psychotherapist with over 30 years experience. I have extensive experience working with individuals, couples, families and groups. I specialize in the treatment of anxiety and depression, relationship issues, family discord, conflict resolution, personal growth, and adjustment to life transitions (including marriage, divorce, remarriage, loss of loved one, infertility, inheritance issues, relocation, illness, infidelity).</p>
                
                <p>For therapy to work, the client and therapist have to "click." I have been often told that I am warm, supportive and insightful, smart and easy to talk too. I only accept clients that I firmly believe that I can help.</p>

                    <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
                    <p>I provide individual, couple and family therapy via Telehealth and in my office in Jerusalem. I believe in a holistic approach utilizing the bio-psycho-social model. After conducting an assessment, I customize treatment to best suit the needs of each individual client. The treatment modalities I incorporate in my work include aspects of psychodynamic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) internal family systems (IFS), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), interpersonal therapy, humanistic therapy, and existential therapy. I am licensed in Florida and New York.</p>

                    <h3>Coaching</h3>
                    <p>I provide coaching to clients to help them with personal growth and to achieve their goals and aspirations. There are several differences between coaching and psychotherapy including licensing requirements, legalities, focus and approach. After a consultation and assessment, I can help you clarify which approach is better suited for you and if I am the appropriate person to help you meet your goals.</p>

                    <p>I am licensed to provide supervision to social workers in New York and Florida. I have been supervising for over 20 years and have helped professionals learn both the theoretical and practical skills to provide psychotherapy as well as the ethics crucial in practice. I will work with you in a collaborative manner to help you build a practice and meet your professional goals.</p>

                    <p><em>Who is a wise? He who learns from everyone. (Ethics of the Fathers)</em></p>
                    <p>I am a big believer in the many benefits of the group process. I began leading groups in 1995 and have lead groups addressing a variety of life's challenges and issues including anxiety, aging, interpersonal growth, stress and anxiety reduction, improving relationships and dealing with spouses who struggle with issues (pornography, affairs same sex attraction). Please contact me to find out which groups are currently running or are in formation.</p>
                    <p>Group therapy offers numerous benefits, including a supportive environment for sharing experiences, reducing feelings of isolation, and fostering personal growth. It also provides opportunities for developing social skills, receiving feedback from others, and learning new coping mechanisms. Moreover, group therapy is often more affordable than individual therapy.</p>
