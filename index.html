                <h2>About Aliza Schulman</h2>
                <p>I am a licensed psychotherapist with over 30 years experience. I have extensive experience working with individuals, couples, families and groups. I specialize in the treatment of anxiety and depression, relationship issues, family discord, conflict resolution, personal growth, and adjustment to life transitions (including marriage, divorce, remarriage, loss of loved one, infertility, inheritance issues, relocation, illness, infidelity).</p>
                
                <p>For therapy to work, the client and therapist have to "click." I have been often told that I am warm, supportive and insightful, smart and easy to talk too. I only accept clients that I firmly believe that I can help.</p>

                    <p>I provide individual, couple and family therapy via Telehealth and in my office in Jerusalem. I believe in a holistic approach utilizing the bio-psycho-social model. After conducting an assessment, I customize treatment to best suit the needs of each individual client. The treatment modalities I incorporate in my work include aspects of psychodynamic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) internal family systems (IFS), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), interpersonal therapy, humanistic therapy, and existential therapy. I am licensed in Florida and New York.</p>

There are several differences between coaching and psychotherapy including licensing requirements, legalities, focus and approach.

                    <p>I am a big believer in the many benefits of the group process. I began leading groups in 1995 and have lead groups addressing a variety of life's challenges and issues including anxiety, aging, interpersonal growth, stress and anxiety reduction, improving relationships and dealing with spouses who struggle with issues (pornography, affairs same sex attraction).</p>
                    <p>Group therapy offers numerous benefits, including a supportive environment for sharing experiences, reducing feelings of isolation, and fostering personal growth. It also provides opportunities for developing social skills, receiving feedback from others, and learning new coping mechanisms. Moreover, group therapy is often more affordable than individual therapy.</p>
